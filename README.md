# Student Performance Prediction

## End-to-End Data Science Project

This project encapsulates the full lifecycle of a data science initiative, from the initial problem formulation through to the deployment of a machine learning model into production. The goal is to provide actionable insights or predictive capabilities based on data analysis and modeling.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to follow best practices in data science and software development, ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance. It includes the following components:

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated scripts to fetch or generate the project's data.
- **Data Transformation**: A pipeline that prepares the data for analysis by cleaning and structuring it.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Jupyter notebooks or scripts that explore the data to find patterns, relationships, anomalies, etc.
- **Feature Engineering**: Code to transform raw data into features suitable for model training.
- **Model Training**: Scripts to train machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance with various metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of model parameters for the best performance.
- **Deployment**: Deployment of the model into a production environment using Flask for creating a web application and GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows in Azure Cloud.

### Project Structure Components

- **Pipelines**: For automating data processing and model training workflows.
- **Exception Handling and Logging**: Custom modules for managing exceptions and logging throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests for code reliability and stability.
